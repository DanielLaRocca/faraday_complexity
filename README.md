# Faraday Complexity
This project is an attempt to create a machine-learning algorithm (binary classifier) that will be able to tell whether a polarized radio spectrum is a simple "Faraday thin" source or a more complex source with multiple components or "Faraday thick". The work is in collaboration with the POSSUM survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). 
Bellow is an example of a simple Faraday thin source produced with create_spectrum.py
