# Faraday Complexity
This project is an attempt to create a machine-learning algorithm (binary classifier) that will be able to tell whether a polarized radio spectrum is a simple "Faraday thin" source or a more complex source with multiple components or "Faraday thick". The work is collaboration with the POSSUM survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (POSSUM). 
Bellow is an example of a simple Faraday thin source
